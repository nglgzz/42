# [42 Keyboard](../README.md) â€“ Case

## Work In Progress

The STL files in this folder are outdated, I'll add the new (low and regular
profile) STLs once I'm done designing them.

## 3D printing

The enclosure can be made in two ways depending on the machines you have
available.

You can print the top piece and the bottom in one piece.

Or, if they are too big to print in one piece (this was the case for me), you
can print them in two pieces (left and right), and glue them together.

In both cases all parts are meant to be printed face down with no supports and
top and bottom are meant to be pieced together using M3x8 screws.
