## 42 keyboard case

The enclosure can be made in two ways depending on the machines you have
available.

You can print the top piece and the bottom in one piece.

Or, if they are too big to print in one piece (this was the case for me), you
can print them in two pieces (left and right), and glue them together.

In both cases top and bottom are meant to be pieced together using M3x8 screws.
