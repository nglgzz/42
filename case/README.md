# [42 Keyboard](../README.md) â€“ Case

## 3D printing

The enclosure can be made in two ways depending on the machines you have
available.

You can print the top piece and the bottom in one piece.

Or, if they are too big to print in one piece (this was the case for me), you
can print them in two pieces (left and right), and glue them together.

In both cases all parts are meant to be printed face down with no supports. The
holes in the top piece are for heat set inserts, and the two pieces are meant to
be pieced together using M3x8 screws.
