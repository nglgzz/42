## Notes

- Prices don't include shipping and potential import taxes.
- Mouser prices don't include VAT.
- The minimum order on JLC PCB is 5 circuit boards, so the price above is for 5
  circuit boards.
- You can order all the parts from Mouser through [this project](https://eu.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=76f07a2210).
  This allows you to order just by saying how many keyboards you want, no need
  to manually add all parts to your cart (I added some extra parts for
  components that are tiny and hard to solder).

### If you live in the EU

- JLC PCB offers [DHL Packet European](https://twitter.com/JLCPCB/status/1244461189200920576)
  as a shipping method. It takes between 4-8 business days and you will not be
  charged import taxes as they will ship to you from their European distributor.
  Depending on where in the EU you are located, the cost of PCBs and how much
  you're willing to wait, this might be your best option.
- It's a good idea to check [this page](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/individuals/buying-goods-services-online-personal-use/buying-goods/buying-goods-online-coming-from-a-noneu-union-country_en)
  and your local customs agency website to get an idea of the fees you'll
  have to pay when ordering from outside the EU.
- QMK suggests to buy the Proton C from mykeyboard.eu if you're in Europe, but
  I've never seen it in stock there. My suggestion is to buy it from
  [/r/mechmarket](https:/reddit/com/r/mechmarket), or order it from the US.

## Alternatives

- Switches, keycaps, and cables – plenty of resellers are listed in the
  [/r/MechanicalKeyboards Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/recommendedsellers).

- Electronics – Farnell should have a similar catalog as Mouser. Just make sure
  to use the manufacturer number you find when following the Mouser links. They
  contain information about model, pin count and other variables, and they will
  save you from buying wrong or needlessly expensive components.

- PCBs – In my experience JLC PCB was always the cheapest option, but that might
  be different if you're located somewhere else. You can check
  [PCB Shopper](https://pcbshopper.com/) to compare PCB manufacturers in your
  location.
