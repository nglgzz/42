## Notes

- Prices don't include shipping and potential import taxes.
- The minimum order on JLC PCB is 5 circuit boards, so the price above is for 5
  circuit boards.

### If you live in the EU

- JLC PCB offers [DHL Packet European](https://twitter.com/JLCPCB/status/1244461189200920576)
  as a shipping method. It takes between 4-8 business days and you will not be
  charged import taxes as they will ship to you from their European distributor.
  Depending on where in the EU you are located, the cost of PCBs and how much
  you're willing to wait, this might be your best option.
- It's a good idea to check [this page](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/individuals/buying-goods-services-online-personal-use/buying-goods/buying-goods-online-coming-from-a-noneu-union-country_en)
  and your local customs agency website to get an idea of the fees you'll
  have to pay when ordering from outside the EU.
- QMK suggests to buy the Proton C from mykeyboard.eu if you're in Europe, but
  I've never seen it in stock there. My suggestion is to buy it from
  [/r/mechmarket](https:/reddit/com/r/mechmarket), or order it from the US.

## Alternatives

- Switches, keycaps, and cables – plenty of resellers are listed in the
  [/r/MechanicalKeyboards Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/recommendedsellers).

- PCBs – In my experience JLC PCB was always the cheapest option, but that might
  be different depending on where you are located. You can check
  [PCB Shopper](https://pcbshopper.com/) to compare PCB manufacturers in your
  location.
