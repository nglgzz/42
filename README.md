# 42

42 is an ergonomic keyboard with the following features:

- 40% layout
- handwired
- orthogonal
- Bluetooth enabled

It uses the Feather 32u4 controller, and its layout is defined using the QMK
firmware. The case is made of four 3D printed pieces glued together. In this
repo you can find all files necessary to build and configure one yourself.

  Even if you don't end up putting into practice what's written in this guide,
  it will definitely be helpful for understanding how things are connected in
  a keyboard.

  Here you can find most of what you need to know for designing a PCB. You might
  need to search for some things that are not covered there, like how to create a
  footprint for a component that is not present in any library. The basics are
  all covered though.
