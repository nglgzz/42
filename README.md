# 42 Keyboard

40%, splittable, mechanical keyboard.

## Project Structure

- [Build](./build/README.md) – Build log, bill of materials, tips on where to
  source parts, assembling tips, learning resources I used while designing this
  keyboard.

- [Case](./case/README.md) – Fusion 360 project and STL files for 3D printing
  the enclosure.

- [Firmware](./firmware/README.md) – QMK configuration. There is a Makefile to
  build and load the firmware.

- [PCB](./pcb/README.md) – Kicad project and Gerber files for manufacturing the
  circuit board.

## Why?

In January 2018 I wanted a keyboard with a specific set of features. The
simplest options to get that keyboard were to wait for a group-buy or build my
own. Waiting time and costs for both options seemed similar, so I went with the
option where I would learn the most.

Needs and knowledge changed over time, so I made different iterations to add new
features and account for the lessons learned from previous builds.

## Features

- 40% – All keys can be reached with minimal finger movement.
- Splittable – You can split the keyboard for more comfort, or use it as one
  piece for better portability.
- Hot-swappable switches – No desoldering pain if you want to try new switches.
